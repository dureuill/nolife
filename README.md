Open a scope and then freeze it in time for future access.

This crate allows constructing structs that contain references and keeping them alive alongside the data they reference,
without a lifetime.

This is especially useful for zero-copy parsers that construct elaborate (and possibly costly) representations that borrow
the source data.

This crate achieves that by leveraging `async` functions. At their core, `async` functions are self-referential structs. this crate simply provides a way to ex-filtrate references outside of the async function, in a controlled manner.

# Using this crate

After you identified the data and its borrowed representation that you'd like to access without a lifetime, using this crate will typically encompass a few steps:

```rust
// Given the following types:
struct MyData(Vec<u8>);
struct MyParsedData<'a>(&'a mut MyData, /* ... */);

// 1. Define a helper type that will express where the lifetimes of the borrowed representation live.
struct MyParsedDataFamily; // empty type, no lifetime.
impl<'a> nolife::Family<'a> for MyParsedDataFamily {
    type Family = MyParsedData<'a>; // Indicates how the type is tied to the trait's lifetime.
    // you generally want to replace all lifetimes in the struct with the one of the trait.
}

// 2. Define a function that setups the data and its borrowed representation:
fn my_scope(
    data_source: Vec<u8>, // ðŸ‘ˆ all parameters that allow to build a `MyData`
) -> impl nolife::TopScope<Family = MyParsedDataFamily> // ðŸ‘ˆ use the helper type we declared
{
    nolife::scope!({
        let mut data = MyData(data_source);
        let mut parsed_data = MyParsedData(&mut data); // imagine that this step is costly...
        freeze_forever!(&mut parsed_data) // gives access to the parsed data to the outside.
                       /* ðŸ‘† reference to the borrowed data */
    })
}

// 3. Open a `BoxScope` using the previously written async function:
let mut scope = nolife::BoxScope::<MyParsedDataFamily>::new_dyn(my_scope(vec![0, 1, 2]));

// 4. Store the `BoxScope` anywhere you want
struct ContainsScope {
    scope: nolife::BoxScope<MyParsedDataFamily>,
    /* other data */
}

// 5. Lastly, enter the scope to retrieve access to the referenced value.
scope.enter(|parsed_data| { /* do what you need with the parsed data */ });
```

# Features

This crate exposes the following Cargo features:

- `std` (default): enable std support and disable `no_std` support.
  - This feature exists so that disabling it allows an explicit opt-in into [the `no_std` attribute](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/names/preludes.html#the-no_std-attribute).
  - Currently `nolife` does not expose additional APIs available only to the `std` feature, so this feature only exists for backward compatibility at this point.
  - The `std` feature is enabled by default so that future APIs depending on that feature are available by default
  - To disable and opt-in into `no_std`, [add `nolife` to your dependencies using `default-features = false`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features).
  - `nolife` requires [the `alloc` crate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/).


# Kinds of scopes

This crate only provide a single kind of scope at the moment

|Scope|Allocations|Moveable after opening|Thread-safe|
|-----|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
|[`BoxScope`]|1 (size of the contained Future + 1 pointer to the reference type)|Yes|No|

An `RcScope` or `MutexScope` could be future extensions

# Alternative

[`yoke`] serves a similar use case as this crate, albeit it is expressed in terms of a self-referential struct rather than as an async scope, which is less natural if the intent is to borrow some data.
